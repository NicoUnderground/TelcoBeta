# TelcoBeta

This is a project I will come back to one day, to crowdsource feedback about proposed changes to legislation. 


## The process
1. The initial Bill would be posted on GitHub
2. The ammendment Bill would be translated into changes to the original Bill via Git. 
3. Contributors can make further changes and comment on their push requests

I will one day return to this, but for now here is a rough markdown version of the Telecommunications (New Regulatory Framework) Amendment Bill
