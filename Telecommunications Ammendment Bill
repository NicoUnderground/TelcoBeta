General policy statement
```
The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Telecommunications Act 2001 (the **Act** ) to—

- establish a stable and predictable regulatory framework for fibre fixed line ac-
    cess services in New Zealand:
- remove unnecessary copper fixed line access service regulation:
- streamline regulatory processes to enable a rapid response to any competition
    problems, particularly in the mobile communications market:
- provide more regulatory oversight of retail service quality.

The new regulatory framework has been designed following a statutory review, as re-
quired under section 157AA of the Act (the **Review** ). The Review was conducted be-
tween 2012 and 2017. Consultation took place through a series of discussion docu-
ments, options papers, and final policy design papers, which are available at: [http://](http://)

nications-act-2001.

### Key Review findings and rationale for change

The communications sector is a key enabler of economic growth. The Government’s
goal is to support a communications environment that provides high-quality and af-
fordable services for all New Zealanders, and enables the New Zealand economy to
grow, innovate, and compete in a dynamic global environment.

The Act provides the underlying economic regulation of communications markets in
New Zealand.

```
293—
```

The Review examined whether the current regulatory framework for telecommunica-
tions in New Zealand is the optimal one for competition, investment, and innovation
after 2020. It concluded that there was a need for change given the evolution of the
telecommunications environment, the growth in fibre networks and services, and
changes in the market structure of the industry. These changes require a new approach
to telecommunications regulation to ensure that—

- excessive profits arising from natural monopoly services are limited:
- regulation is stable and predictable:
- regulation is only applied to the extent necessary to address a lack of competi-
    tion:
- regulation can respond rapidly to a changing environment:
- market participants are responsive to consumer demands for service quality.

The key outcome of the Review is the introduction of a new regulatory framework for
fibre fixed line access services to apply from the implementation date (which will be
1 January 2020 or a date within 2 years of 1 January 2020). The new framework is
based on utility regulation in Part 4 of the Commerce Act 1986, and includes 2 types
of regulation: price-quality regulation and information disclosure regulation.

From the implementation date, Chorus Limited ( **Chorus** ) will be subject to price-
quality and information disclosure regulation, and 4 fibre service providers (Ultrafast
Fibre Limited, Enable Networks Limited, Northpower Fibre Limited, and Northpower
LFC2 Limited) will be subject to information disclosure regulation.

Under this form of price-quality regulation, Chorus will, for at least the first 3-year
regulatory period, be subject to a revenue cap and must provide certain anchor ser-
vices to its wholesale fibre customers. Under information disclosure regulation, Cho-
rus and the 3 other fibre service providers must disclose information publicly to
enable scrutiny of their performance and profitability.

The regulatory framework will be implemented by the Commerce Commission (the
**Commission** ), led by the Telecommunications Commissioner.

In the areas where fibre services are available, the copper network operated by Cho-
rus will be deregulated and the telecommunications service obligations ( **TSO** ) will
cease to apply. Chorus may continue to operate the copper fixed-line network in these
areas, but it will not be required to do so by regulation.

Withdrawal of the copper network by Chorus in a given area will, however, be regu-
lated by a copper withdrawal code that sets out minimum conditions that must be met
before a copper line can be withdrawn.

New regulatory arrangements will be introduced to support consumer service quality
across the sector and improve responsiveness to consumer needs. These arrangements
enable the Commission—

- to collect information and report on the quality of retail service delivery in a
    way that is accessible to consumers:

2
**Amendment Bill** Explanatory note


- to establish regulatory codes to improve retail service quality, if industry self-
    regulation is inadequate:
- to undertake periodic reviews of industry-led dispute resolution schemes.

### Specific changes provided by the Bill

The Bill—

- provides for the establishment of a new utility regulation framework for fibre
    fixed line access services from the implementation date:
- deregulates copper fixed line access services in areas where fibre services are
    available to consumers, while retaining regulation in areas where fibre is not
    available:
- puts in place consumer safeguards when copper services are to be withdrawn:
- streamlines the process for recommending regulation of services in Schedule 3
    of the Act:
- requires the Commission to undertake retail service quality monitoring:
- provides more regulatory oversight of retail service quality, associated consum-
    er codes, and dispute resolution processes in the telecommunications sector:
- provides for technical revisions to the Telecommunications Regulatory Levy
    ( **TRL** ), which provide for consistency with the levy arrangements for utility
    regulation under the Commerce Act 1986:
- repeals unused, unnecessary, or expired provisions, and updates organisational
    references.

These specific aspects of the Bill are addressed in further detail below.

### A new regulatory framework

The Bill incorporates into the Act arrangements for utility regulation that have been
tested in Part 4 of the Commerce Act 1986. The Commission will establish input
methodologies and undertake other preparatory work, with the aim of applying the
new regulatory framework from 1 January 2020.

**Regulation of fibre fixed line access services**

The new regulatory framework in the Bill will apply the following forms of regula-
tion to Chorus:

- price-quality regulation, where price or revenue controls and requirements for
    service quality are placed on Chorus:
- information disclosure regulation, which ensures that sufficient information
    about Chorus’s performance is available, to assess whether the purpose of the
    regulation is being met.

The Bill provides that local fibre companies ( **LFCs** ) that are building networks pur-
suant to the Government’s Ultra-fast Broadband ( **UFB** ) initiative will also be subject

Explanatory note
**Amendment Bill** 3


to information disclosure regulation, but will not be subject to price-quality regula-
tion. An LFC may later become subject to price-quality regulation, should the Minis-
ter accept a recommendation from the Commission that price-quality regulation is
necessary.

**Establishment of input methodologies**

The Bill provides that input methodologies will be developed by the Commission to
specify in advance the rules and processes applying to information disclosure and
price quality regulation.

The input methodologies will set out rules that apply to the initial setting of the regu-
lated asset base (subject to some additional rules in the Bill itself) and to determining
the allowable revenue for Chorus. They will also be used to establish a stable price
path for fibre anchor services from the implementation date onwards.

Input methodologies will, at a minimum, relate to the following topics:

- cost of capital:
- asset valuation:
- allocation of costs:
- treatment of taxation:
- regulatory processes and rules for the specification of prices and service costs:
- efficient capital expenditure:
- quality dimensions for service provision.

**Anchor services**

The Bill also requires Chorus to offer anchor services, which are wholesale fibre ser-
vices with price caps based on existing UFB prices. Anchor services are intended to
ensure that entry-level broadband and voice-only fibre services are provided by Cho-
rus at reasonable prices and to specific quality standards.

These anchor products will also have an impact beyond the products directly covered,
as they will constrain the price of other fibre services provided by Chorus.

**Price regulation of direct fibre access services**

The Bill provides for pro-competitive regulation of direct fibre access services
( **DFAS** ).

DFAS are business-grade layer 1 fibre services that connect large commercial users to
the fibre network. It is used by mobile providers to provide dedicated fibre links to
the mobile towers that enable mobile companies to provide fixed-wireless services,
and by retail service providers for backhaul and to supply large commercial custom-
ers. Specific price regulation of this service is included in the Bill to reduce the op-
portunity for Chorus to arbitrarily increase the costs of this key input to the services
of fixed wireless competitors. DFAS will have a price cap based on the existing UFB
price.

4
**Amendment Bill** Explanatory note


**Retention of requirement to offer unbundled fibre services**

The Bill maintains the existing obligations for regulated fibre service suppliers to pro-
vide unbundled fibre services from the implementation date. The Bill also enables the
Commission to investigate establishing an unbundled fibre service as a price-regu-
lated service from 2023. These open-access arrangements will enhance service inno-
vation, and support the introduction of new network technologies in the future.

**Deregulation of certain copper fixed line access services**

The Bill refines the regulation of copper fixed line access services from 2020. In
areas where fibre is available, Chorus will no longer be required to supply copper
fixed line access services, or meet the obligations specified in TSO instruments. How-
ever, in areas where fibre services are not available, copper regulation will be main-
tained. In those areas, Chorus will be required to continue to supply certain regulated
copper services, capped at regulated 2019 prices, with inflation adjustments over
time. Chorus’s TSO obligations will also be retained in those areas.

**Copper withdrawal code**

_Clause 7_ of the Bill inserts _new section 69AF_ into the Act to provide consumer pro-
tection measures for consumers of copper fixed line access services, in the event that
Chorus seeks to stop supplying copper network services. Before Chorus is permitted
to stop supplying a copper service, comparable alternative fibre services must be
available at similar prices, with similar functionality, and certain processes must be
followed to reduce transitional risks.

### Competition in mobile telecommunications markets—Schedule 3 streamlining

The Bill aims to encourage further competition in the mobile market through stream-
lining the process for Commission investigations into regulating telecommunications
services in Schedule 3 of the Act.

The Bill will amend the Schedule 3 process to—

- impose a hard deadline of 240 working days for the Commission to complete
    its investigation and recommend to the Minister for Communications whether
    to regulate a telecommunications service (120 working days for investigations
    in relation to the upgrade of an existing service):
- provide the Commission with the flexibility to decide whether to hold confer-
    ences and public hearings:
- allow for a single undertakings process in place of successive incremental
    undertakings, which can reduce the effect of the regulatory process and delay
    determinations:
- enable the Commission to propose a single-stage pricing process when recom-
    mending regulation to the Minister for Communications (instead of a 2-stage
    process involving first international benchmarking and then cost modelling).

Explanatory note
**Amendment Bill** 5


These changes allow for more timely intervention by the Commission when issues are
identified, and further encourage commercial settlements as an alternative to regula-
tion.

### Improving consumer retail service quality

The Bill aims to assist consumers to make informed choices about retail telecommu-
nications services by improving the information available to consumers. More regula-
tory oversight of the development and maintenance of consumer codes will provide
retail service providers with more incentives to improve the quality of their services.
The Bill will also support more efficient and responsive dispute resolution procedures
for consumers.

To meet these policy objectives, the Bill—

- requires the Commission to monitor and report on retail service quality for tele-
    communications consumers, and to make such information readily available to
    consumers:
- allows the Commission to monitor industry-based retail service quality codes
    and allows the Commission to make such codes should industry-led codes be
    assessed as inadequate:
- provides the Commission with the ability to review the performance of indus-
    try-led dispute resolution providers and recommend change:
- incorporates certain remedies from the Fair Trading Act 1986, along with infor-
    mation disclosure, compliance, and enforcement powers from the Commerce
    Act 1986, with some refinements. These compliance and enforcement meas-
    ures allow the Commission to issue civil infringement notices or apply for pe-
    cuniary penalties or other remedies:
- provides for the Commission to accept enforceable undertakings in relation to
    breaches of Commission retail service quality codes.

Following a Commission retail service quality code breach, the Commission may also
seek orders from the High Court for the disclosure of information or publication of
corrective statements.

Remedies equivalent to those in the Fair Trading Act 1986 will enable the High Court
to issue orders directing the payment of a refund, return of property, payment of loss
or damage, and supply of specified services.

### Technical revisions to levy provisions

The new regulatory obligations to be inserted in _new Part 6_ of the Act will take a
number of years to complete and implement. The Bill provides for a minor change in
levy arrangements to enable levies to be set over a multi-year appropriation period,
rather than a financial year. This enables consistency with similar levy-setting ar-
rangements provided in Part 4 of the Commerce Act 1986. The approach in the Bill
enables the TRL to be revised on a multi-year basis, subject to full consultation. It

6
**Amendment Bill** Explanatory note


also enables input methodology regulatory development to be commenced and re-
sourced before the first regulatory period commences.

### Miscellaneous revisions

The Bill repeals redundant miscellaneous provisions in the Act, as follows:

- an outdated criminal offence of indecent telephone calls for pecuniary gain
    (section 113):
- sections within Part 2A relating to the structural separation of Telecom that are
    no longer needed:
- expired provisions in the Act:
- the requirement for the Minister to review the regulatory framework, as this re-
    view has now been completed:
- line-of-business restrictions for Chorus that do not add to the retained funda-
    mental prohibition on participation in retail (sections 69R and 69S).

In addition, outdated references to Telecom, Spark, and the Ministry of Economic De-
velopment will be updated.

Explanatory note
**Amendment Bill** 7


```
Clause by clause analysis
```
_Clause 1_ is the Title clause.

_Clause 2_ is the commencement clause. Most of the Bill comes into force on the day
after Royal assent. However, the following provisions have a later commencement
date for transitional reasons:

- _clause 11_ , in so far as it repeals provisions that lead to Chorus’s unbundled cop-
    per local loop network and Chorus’s unbundled copper local loop network
    backhaul (distribution cabinet to telephone exchange) ceasing to be designated
    services within Part 2 of Schedule 1, comes into force on 1 January 2020:
- _clause 35_ , in so far as it repeals subpart 3 of Part 4AA (which relates to infor-
    mation disclosure regulation), comes into force on 1 January 2022.

While most of the Act commences on the day after Royal assent, a number of the pro-
visions only have practical consequences on and after the implementation date ( _see_
note on _clause 4_ below). The implementation date mechanism is used to allow greater
flexibility in case the Commerce Commission is not able to implement the new regu-
latory framework on and after 1 January 2020.

_Clause 3_ identifies the Telecommunications Act 2001 (the **principal Act** ) as the prin-
cipal Act being amended.

The Bill is in 3 Parts as follows:

- _Part 1_ includes amendments to definitions and amendments related to copper
    fixed line access services:
- _Part 2_ includes amendments related to fibre fixed line access services:
- _Part 3_ includes amendments related to consumer matters, consequential
    amendments, and other miscellaneous amendments.

## Part 1

## Amendments to definitions and amendments related to copper fixed

## line access services

_Clause 4_ amends section 5 to insert new definitions, and to update the definitions of
access provider and access seeker in relation to fibre services. The more important
new definitions inserted include the following:

- copper fixed line access services, which are Chorus’s unbundled bitstream ac-
    cess and Chorus’s unbundled copper low frequency service:
- fibre fixed line access service, which is a telecommunications service that ena-
    bles access to, and interconnection with, a regulated fibre service provider’s fi-
    bre network (subject to specified exceptions):
- implementation date, which is 1 January 2020 or a date up to 2 years later than
    1 January 2020:

8
**Amendment Bill** Explanatory note


- regulated fibre service provider, which is a person prescribed in regulations as
    being subject to 1 or both of price-quality regulation and information disclos-
    ure regulation:
- retail service quality code, which means a code of conduct relating to retail ser-
    vice quality that applies to the provision of 1 or more types of telecommunica-
    tions service:
- specified fibre area, which is a geographic area in which fibre fixed line access
    services are available to end-users.

_Clause 5_ amends section 19 to require the Commission and the Minister to consider
the purpose set out in section 18 when making a recommendation, determination, or
decision under _new Part 2AA_.

_Clause 6_ amends section 66 to reflect that not all telecommunications services in
Schedule 1 will always have an initial pricing principle.

_Clause 7_ inserts _new Part 2AA_ , which deregulates certain copper telecommunications
services and includes the following new provisions:

- _new section 69AA_ , which sets out the purpose of the Part:
- _new section 69AB_ , which sets out the process for the Commission to investi-
    gate and declare an area to be a specified fibre area:
- _new sections 69AC and 69AD_ , which set out the requirement for Chorus to
    continue to supply services that become deregulated unless Chorus complies
    with the copper withdrawal code:
- _new section 69AE_ , which provides that specified TSO instruments cease to
    apply in areas that become specified fibre areas:
- _new section 69AF_ , which is the operative provision for _new Schedule 2A_ ,
    which sets out the framework for the copper withdrawal code:
- _new section 69AG_ , which provides for the continued application of specified
    standard terms determinations:
- _new section 69AH_ , which requires the Commission to investigate the regulation
    of specified copper telecommunications services by 31 December 2025 (or to
    provide reasons why there were no reasonable grounds to start such an investi-
    gation).

_Clause 8_ amends section 69XA to exclude services supplied in relation to end-users
in specified fibre areas from the definitions of relevant regulated services and relevant
services.

_Clause 9_ amends section 157 to insert a regulation-making power related to the cop-
per withdrawal code.

_Clause 10_ inserts _new Part 2_ into Schedule 1AA of the principal Act. _New Part 2_
contains transitional provisions related to the Bill as follows:

- _new clause 7_ sets out the process by which the implementation date may be de-
    ferred for up to a maximum of 2 years beyond 1 January 2020:

Explanatory note
**Amendment Bill** 9


- _new clause 8_ sets out the transitional rule for local fibre companies that are or
    may be subject to information disclosure requirements under both subpart 3 of
    Part 4AA and _new Part 6_ :
- _new clause 9_ modifies _new section 206_ in relation to anchor services reviews
    that take place before the implementation date:
- _new clause 10_ modifies the procedural requirements that apply to the regula-
    tion-making power in _new section 222_ in relation to regulations made before
    the start of the first regulatory period:
- _new clauses 11 to 13_ modify the procedural requirements that apply to speci-
    fied regulation-making powers in relation to the first regulations made under
    _new sections 223, 224, and 225_.

_Clause 11_ amends Schedule 1 of the principal Act. The most important changes are as
follows:

- repealing out-of-date references to separation day in relation to designated ser-
    vices:
- updating initial and final pricing principles for designated services to reflect
    new standard terms determinations:
- amending the specification of Chorus’s unbundled bitstream access and Chor-
    us’s unbundled copper low frequency service to include a geographical condi-
    tion that the services are not supplied in relation to an end-user in a specified
    fibre area:
- deleting Chorus’s unbundled copper local loop network and Chorus’s unbun-
    dled copper local loop network backhaul (distribution cabinet to telephone ex-
    change) from the list of designated services (with effect on and after 1 January
    2020).

_Clause 12_ inserts _new Schedule 2A_ into the principal Act. _New Schedule 2A_ contains
the framework provisions for the copper withdrawal code, including a requirement for
the Commission (or the Forum) to prepare the code and the minimum consumer pro-
tection requirements that the code must contain.

_Clause 13_ amends Schedule 3 of the principal Act to change the procedure for inves-
tigations that take place under Schedule 3. The most important change is to insert new
hard deadlines for when the Commission must complete investigations under Sched-
ule 3.

_Clause 14_ amends Schedule 3A of the principal Act to streamline the undertaking
procedure in that schedule by restricting access providers from making multiple ap-
plications in relation to undertakings.

with requirements determined by the Commission. _New sections 186 to 188_ set out
the effect of being subject to information disclosure regulation and list the detailed
types of information a provider may be required to disclose.

_New subpart 5_ relates to price-quality regulation and provides that certain regulated
fibre service providers are required to apply the price-quality paths determined by the
Commission. In particular,—

- _new section 192_ sets out the effect of being subject to price-quality regulation:
- _new section 193_ sets out what a price-quality path must contain, including re-
    quirements related to maximum revenues and maximum prices:
- _new section 194_ requires the price-quality path for each regulatory period that
    starts before the reset date ( _see_ the note on _new section 215_ below) to specify

    vider:
- _new section 195_ is related to _new section 194_ and requires the maximum reve-
    nues specified in a price-quality path for a regulatory period that starts before
    the reset date (except for the first regulatory period) to be calculated using the
    specified wash-up mechanism:
- _new sections 197 and 198_ require regulated fibre service providers to provide,
    during the relevant prescribed period, anchor services and direct fibre access
    services at a price that is no greater than the relevant prescribed maximum
    price:
- _new section 199_ requires regulated fibre service providers to provide, during
    the prescribed period, unbundled fibre services at a price that is no greater than
    any prescribed maximum price:

    vices (including specifications and maximum prices):

12
**Amendment Bill** Explanatory note


- _new section 207_ provides a power for the Commission to review the require-
    ment for price-quality paths to specify maximum revenues, and provisions re-
    lating to the requirement to provide direct fibre access services and unbundled
    fibre services:

    regulation review.

_New subpart 8_ contains provisions relating to—

- enforcement; and
- the powers of the Commission, incorporation of material by reference, and the
    disclosure of commercially sensitive information.

The enforcement provisions are based on sections 86 to 90 (except sections 86C and
89) of the Commerce Act 1986. However the maximum penalty included in _new sec-
tion 213_ is higher than its equivalent provision in section 87 of the Commerce Act.
The provisions include the following:

- _new section 210_ , which provides for pecuniary penalties for breaching informa-
    tion disclosure requirements:

    a regulated fibre service provider to comply with an information disclosure re-
    quirement:

    regulation:
- _new section 213_ , which provides for pecuniary penalties for breaching price-
    quality requirements (including a maximum penalty of $10,000,000):
- _new section 214_ , which provides for the High Court to make an order requiring
    a person who breaches a price-quality requirement to pay compensation to a
    person who suffers loss or damage as a result of the breach:
- _new section 215_ , which contains offences relating to price-quality regulation:
- _new section 216_ , which provides the High Court with a power to grant injunc-
    tions or to require a regulated fibre services provider to provide fibre fixed line
    access services.

_New subpart 9_ relates to appeals and is based on section 91 of the Commerce Act

1986. _New section 220_ provides general rights of appeal to the High Court against a
determination under _new Part 6_ , subject to specified exceptions.

_New subpart 10_ contains order-making and regulation-making powers as follows:

- _new section 221_ contains a power for the Governor-General to declare the date
    after which price-quality paths are not required to specify a maximum revenue
    requirement:
- _new section 222_ contains a power for the Governor-General to prescribe a per-
    son as being subject to 1 or both of price-quality regulation and information
    disclosure regulation. In relation to the first regulatory period, this power is ex-

pected to be used to prescribe Chorus as being subject to price-quality regula-
tion and information disclosure regulation and the local fibre companies as be-
ing subject to information disclosure regulation:
```
- _new section 223_ contains a power for the Governor-General to prescribe vari-
    ous matters related to anchor services:

    ous matters related to unbundled fibre services:
- _new section 226_ contains a power for the Governor-General to prescribe points
    of interconnection for the purposes of establishing fibre handover points.

## Part 3

## Amendments related to consumer matters, consequential

## amendments, and other miscellaneous amendments

_Clause 24_ amends section 9A to confer additional functions on the Commission to
monitor and report on retail service quality in relation to telecommunications ser-
vices. _Clause 24_ also amends section 9A to provide the Commission with a power to
require service providers to prepare and produce certain information.

_Clause 25_ amends section 156A to add failing to comply with a Commission retail
service quality code or the copper withdrawal code to the list of breaches to which
section 156B (which relates to enforcement) applies.

_Clause 26_ amends section 156B to allow the following additional enforcement op-
tions in relation to a breach of a Commission retail service quality code or the copper
withdrawal code:

- an option for the Commission to accept undertakings under _new section 156CA_
    as an alternative to serving a civil infringement notice or applying to the High
    Court for an order under section 156L:
- in relation to a breach of a Commission retail service quality code, an option
    for the Commission to apply to the High Court for an order under any of the
    following:
    - _new section 156MA_ , which relates to disclosing information:
    - _new section 156MB_ , which contains a power for the High Court to make

       vices:
- in relation to a breach of the copper withdrawal code, an option for the Com-
    mission to apply to the High Court for an order under any of the following:

14
**Amendment Bill** Explanatory note


- _new section 156MC_ , which contains a power for the High Court to make
    orders requiring a provider to compensate an end-user for loss or dam-
    age or supply services to the end-user:
- _new section 156MD_ , which contains a power for the High Court to grant
    an injunction against a provider.

_Clause 27_ inserts _new section 156BA_ , which allows an end-user to take enforcement
action under _new sections 156MC and 156MD_ in certain situations.

_Clause 28_ inserts _new sections 156CA and 156CB_. _New section 156CA_ allows the
Commission to accept an undertaking from a person in relation to a breach of a Com-
mission retail service quality code or the copper withdrawal code. _New section 156CB_
contains the penalties for breach of an undertaking, which include a power for the
court to make an order requiring the person in breach to pay a pecuniary penalty.

_Clause 29_ inserts _new sections 156MA to 156MD_ , which relate to additional remedies
for breach of a Commission retail service quality code or the copper withdrawal code
( _see_ the note on _clause 26_ above).

_Clause 30_ replaces section 156T in Part 4B. Part 4B, which relates to consumer com-
plaints, was inserted into the principal Act by section 54 of the Telecommunications
Amendment Act (No 2) 2006 but is not yet in force. Section 156S provides that Part
4B comes into force on a date to be appointed by the Governor-General, by Order in
Council, made on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with section
156T. Section 156T contains the process that must be followed before the Minister
can recommend that Part 4B comes into force. _New section 156T_ contains the follow-
ing additional situation in which the Minister can recommend that Part 4B should
come into force:

- if the Commission reports to the Minister, under _new section 240_ , that the in-
    dustry dispute resolution scheme fails to achieve the purpose of a dispute reso-
    lution scheme (as defined in _new section 241_ ) or the industry dispute resolution
    scheme provider fails to meet the purpose of a scheme provider (as defined in
    _new section 242_ ).

_Clauses 31 and 32_ amend sections 156UA and 156Y in Part 4B. These amended sec-
tions clarify the relationship between a consumer complaints system under Part 4B
and a Commission retail service quality code under _new Part 7_.

_Clause 33_ inserts _new Part 7_. _New Part 7_ contains provisions relating to consumer
matters, and in particular contains provisions regarding retail service quality codes
and dispute resolution schemes. The new provisions include—

- _new section 227_ , which provides that the purpose of a retail service quality
    code is to improve retail service quality for consumers of telecommunications
    services:
- _new section 228_ , which contains definitions (the most important of which de-
    fines the industry dispute resolution scheme as the Telecommunications Dis-
    pute Resolution Scheme established by the Forum):

Explanatory note

    service quality code must contain:

- _new section 234_ , which provides that the industry dispute resolution scheme is
    to be the dispute resolution scheme for all Commission retail service quality
    codes (unless Part 4B of the principal Act comes into force):
- _new section 235_ , which provides that disputes in relation to a Commission re-
    tail service quality code may be referred to the industry dispute resolution
    scheme:
- _new sections 236 to 239_ , which are based on sections 155ZJ to 155ZL of the
    principal Act, and which set out how decisions of the industry dispute reso-
    lution scheme are binding and the rights of appeal that exist:
- _new section 240_ , which requires the Commission to review all industry dispute
    resolution schemes at least once every 3 years and provide reports and recom-
    mendations to the scheme provider or the Minister (as appropriate):
- _new section 241_ , which provides that the purpose of a dispute resolution
    scheme is to ensure that, if a consumer has a dispute with a service provider in
    relation to a retail service quality code, the consumer has access to a dispute
    resolution scheme for resolving that dispute in a timely manner:
- _new section 242_ , which sets out the purpose of a dispute resolution scheme pro-
    vider:
- _new section 243_ , which sets out the relationship between remedies available
    under _new Part 7_ and remedies available under other provisions.

_Clause 34_ replaces each reference to Telecom identified in _Schedule 4_ with a refer-
ence to Spark.

_Clause 35_ repeals provisions that are obsolete, redundant, or no longer necessary in
light of the new regulatory framework in _new Part 6_. These repeals include the fol-
lowing:

- sections 30U to 30ZD, which relate to residual terms determinations:
- Part 2B, which relates to information disclosure:

16
**Amendment Bill** Explanatory note

_Clause 36_ makes consequential amendments related to the repeals being made by
_clause 35_.

_Clause 37_ makes miscellaneous amendments to update terminology and references to
Telecom.

graded, and new assets; and 20
(b) have incentives to improve efficiency and supply fibre fixed line access
services of a quality that reflects end-user demands; and
(c) allow end-users to share the benefits of efficiency gains in the supply of
fibre fixed line access services, including through lower prices; and
(d) are limited in their ability to extract excessive profits. 25

ces, it must also require that the lowering of prices must be spread over time in
order to minimise undue financial hardship to the regulated fibre service pro- 35
vider.

(3) If the Commission allows a regulated fibre service provider to recover any
shortfall, it must require that any recovery must be spread over time in order to
minimise price shocks to end-users.

any costs that can be passed through to prices (which may not in-
clude the legal costs of any appeals against input methodology de-
terminations under this Part); and 20
(ii) identifying circumstances in which a price-quality path may be re-
considered within a regulatory period; and
(d) methodologies for capital expenditure projects, including the following:
(i) requirements that must be met by the regulated fibre service pro-

(i) incurred by a regulated fibre service provider in constructing or 10
acquiring the fibre asset, net of specified capital contributions; or
(ii) if the fibre asset was owned by Chorus before 1 December 2011,
recorded by Chorus for the fibre asset in its published general pur-
pose financial statements as of 1 December 2011; and
(b) adjusting that cost for accumulated depreciation and impairment losses 15
(if any) recognised by the regulated fibre service provider (ignoring any
accounting adjustment for Crown funding), as at the implementation
date, under generally accepted accounting practice in New Zealand.
```
(2) Each regulated fibre service provider is treated, as at the implementation date,
as owning a fibre asset with an initial value equal to the financial losses, as de- 20
termined by the Commission, incurred by the provider in providing fixed line
access services under the UFB initiative for the period starting on 1 December
2011 and ending on the close of the day immediately before the implementa-
tion date.

(3) To avoid doubt, the initial value of a fibre asset determined under this section 25
includes the costs incurred by the provider in relation to the asset—
(a) as a direct result of meeting specific requirements of the UFB initiative;
and
(b) for both standard and non-standard connections.

(4) In this section,— 30

```
fibre asset means an asset constructed or acquired by a regulated fibre service
provider—
(a) to provide fibre fixed line access services; or
